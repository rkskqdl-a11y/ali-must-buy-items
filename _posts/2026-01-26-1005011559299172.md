**Product:** Stainless Steel Round Hot Pot Ring for Induction Stove Cookware Stabilizer / Heat Diffuser / Kitchen Table Top Hole Protector  
**Price:** $17.24  
**Material:** High-grade Stainless Steel

---

## Overview
If you are a fan of authentic hot pot at home, you know that stability and safety are the most important factors when dealing with boiling broth in the center of the table. The **Stainless Steel Round Hot Pot Ring** is a versatile utility tool designed to bridge the gap between your cookware and your induction stove or tabletop cutout. At **$17.24**, it is a niche but essential investment for serious home chefs.

## Key Features

### 1. Robust Build Quality
Made from polished stainless steel, this ring is built to withstand high temperatures without warping. It is resistant to rust and corrosion, which is vital considering it will frequently be exposed to steam and occasional soup spills.

### 2. Excellent Stability
The primary function of this ring is to act as a **cookware stabilizer**. If you are using a rounded-bottom pot or a pot that doesn't perfectly match the diameter of your induction burner, this ring creates a secure "nest" that prevents the pot from sliding or tipping.

### 3. Tabletop Protector
For those who have a dedicated hot pot table with a pre-cut hole for the burner, this ring acts as a **hole protector**. It covers the rough edges of the cutout and provides a flush, professional-looking finish that prevents debris from falling into the internal components of the table.

### 4. Heat Diffusion & Protection
While induction stoves stay relatively cool, the pot itself becomes extremely hot. This ring helps manage the heat distribution around the edges of the cookware, protecting your tabletop surfaces from direct heat contact.
